# Dragon

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/nightblade9/dragon.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nightblade9/dragon/)

Python to Haxe transpiler, written in Python. (With some caveats.)

Dragon was written for me, personally. At this (very early MVP) stage, the goal is to transpile simple code from Haxe to Python in order to generate fully-runnable HaxeFlixel games.

Once this is successful, over time, I will add more generic functionality to Dragon.

I've also never written a transpiler, so you can expect the code to change and/or get rewritten a few times along the way.
